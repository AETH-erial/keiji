## *keiji*, SSR blog + website using just HTMX and Golang

This is my personal blogging site, in lieu of having social media like Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, etc. I have handrolled my own blogging platform to be used exclusively by me. Designed to be my 'virtual studio', where I can put my art, writings, and various updates onto the internet whilst retaining 99% control over the platform wherein they reside.

### Highlights
- clean contract between the webserver and the database
- embedded web content to make deployments easier
- dynamic population of navigation bars, menu, and the admin panel
- cool mid 2000s website feel
